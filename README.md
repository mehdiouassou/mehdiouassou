### Hi there, I'm Mehdi. 👋

I am a **Software Engineer** based in **Verona**, currently studying Computer Science at **UniVR**.
I specialize in the **Microsoft Stack (.NET/C#)**, but my background is rooted in low-level automation, security research, and legacy system architecture.

I build software that is secure by design, optimized for performance, and commercially viable.

### 🚀 Featured Engineering

#### 👁️ [Legacy Visual Automation](https://github.com/mehdiouassou/legacy-automation-2020)
*A high-performance input overlay for real-time screen analysis.*
*   **Tech:** WinAPI, Vector Logic, DLL Calls.
*   **Engineering:** Implemented a custom smoothing algorithm (Square-Root function) to humanize input vectors. Bypassed standard driver flags using direct `DllCall("mouse_event")`.
*   *(Note: This project demonstrates low-level optimization and vector math).*

#### 🏛️ [Forum Marconi](https://github.com/mehdiouassou/Forum-Marconi)
*A vanilla PHP forum engine built for a high-traffic student community.*
*   **Tech:** PHP, MySQL, CSS3 (No Frameworks).
*   **Engineering:** Implemented custom Session management, BBCode parsing engine, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) manually to ensure security compliance on legacy servers.

#### 🤖 **AI Context Experiments (Private R&D)**
*   **Focus:** Optimizing context windows for LLMs (Claude/DeepSeek) in roleplay and logic scenarios.
*   **Tech:** JSON Structured Outputs, System Prompt Engineering, Temperature Tuning.
